1. Form Handling and Validation
Why: Forms are common in most web apps. Whether it's for user input, a contact form, or managing items, form handling and validation will be essential.
How:
You can use native form handling, or for more complex scenarios, integrate a library like vee-validate for robust form validation.
Benefit: Improves user experience by providing real-time feedback on form errors.

4. Component Library for Reusable UI Elements
Why: Without using pre-built frameworks like Bootstrap, you might want to develop reusable custom components, like buttons, modals, or cards.
How:
Create your own UI components (e.g., Button.vue, Modal.vue) that can be reused throughout the app.
You could also use lightweight libraries such as TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.

7. Dynamic Routes with Vue Router
Why: Dynamic routes can enable more interactive content, like blogs or user profiles.
How:
Set up dynamic routing in Vue Router, using route parameters (:id, etc.) to handle different views based on the URL.
Benefit: Allows for better scalability and content handling, such as rendering pages based on different IDs.

8. Testing
Why: Testing is crucial as your app grows to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
How:
Use tools like Jest for unit testing your components.
For end-to-end testing, tools like Cypress can be set up.
Benefit: Catch bugs early and improve long-term maintainability.

9. Animations and Transitions
Why: To improve the user experience, subtle animations or page transitions can add a layer of polish.
How:
Use Vue's built-in transition features, or integrate libraries like anime.js for more complex animations.
Benefit: Improves the overall feel of the app, making interactions smoother and more visually appealing.

10. Progressive Web App (PWA)
Why: If you want to enable offline access, push notifications, or a more native-like feel, consider turning your app into a PWA.
How:
Vue has an official PWA plugin that makes this easy to set up.
Benefit: Expands your appâ€™s accessibility and performance, especially on mobile
